# Horrorscopes group project 

install:

```sh
clone this repo
npm install
knex migrate:latest
knex seed:run

```
  `npm run dev` for bundling, watch and nodemon
  `npm start` only runs server (setup for heroku)

## Learning goals
- React, Redux, Express, Knex, API, testing, deployment on Heroku

### User stories
As a user I want to 
- see horror horoscopes for different star signs
- add a user and see horrorscope 

### Build by
- Ania
- Mike 
- Usha 
- Carla 

### Bolerplate based

Built on a starter webpack boilerplate for React, Redux, Express and Knex. The boilerplate is a rad base for starting a new full-stack project, or just as reference for how to do things the Harrison Symes way (which is with absolutely no test folder)
